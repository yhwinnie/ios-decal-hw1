//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: [words is already declared as a list of String optionals. Therefore wordA = words[0] and wordB = words[1] do not need the "?". If word[0]/word[1] is not a string, nil will be automatically assigned to wordA/wordB]
    
    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    static func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count

            }

    }
    
//: [In the for loop, i is declared as a constant (let i); therefore, when it tries incrementing i++. Map() is a function that takes in an argument. The function should return a boolean. Change nil to true. Make the function a static method.]
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    static func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool? {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [:]
        var lenA = wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
}

//: [At the end of the function, we had return nil. Instead we should change that to true. We did not initialize the function correctly. We also needed to change the functions into a static method.]


//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
